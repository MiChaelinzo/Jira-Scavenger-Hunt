# Jira-Scavenger-Hunt
The game would be a treasure hunt-style game where players are given tasks to complete using data from Jira issues and Bitbucket pull requests and commits. For example, players may be tasked with finding a specific Jira issue related to a certain project, or they may be asked to submit a pull request to a specific branch on Bitbucket. Players could compete against each other to complete tasks the fastest or with the most accuracy.
